#  1.Introduction to IT
---
## 1.1 introduction
- ***IT:*** The use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information.
- The heart ang soul of IT is really about *people*.
- Internet *has an impact on* education, medicine, journalism, construction, transportation and entertainment.
## 1.2 history of computing
- ***computer:*** A device that stores and processes data by performing calculation.
- in the 17th century, Blaise Pascal invented mechanical calculator, which paved the way for more complex machines.
- in the 1800s, Joseph jacquard invented a programmable loom.
- inspired by punch card, Charles Babbage developed analytical operations that can automtically perform calculations.
- Ada Lovelace developed the first algorithm.
#### ***The path to modern computers***
1. During the World War Two, government provided resources to support the computer to process secret messages.Cryptography--the art of writing and solving codes.
2. Alan Turing developed the top-secret Enigma machine.
3. Admiral Grace invented the first compiler —— Hopper compiler. The first hard disk and micro processors.
4. Xerox Alto, means computer get smaller.
5. Steve Wozniak, the Apple one.
6. IBM, personal computer.
7. Bill Gates, Microsoft and Microsoft Windows operating system.
8. Atari, the first coin-oprated arcade games——pong.
9. Richard Stallman, invented the similar UNIX, which is an open source system.
10. Late 1990s, Nokia introduced the PDA with mobile phone functionality.

## 1.3 digital logic
- Binary system: a base numeral system, only talk in ones and zeros.
- Character Encoding: assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them.
- Encoding standard:ASCII, UTF-8
## 1.4 computer  architecture layer
1. Hardware layer: made up of the physical components of a computer
2. Operrating system
3. Software layer: how we humans interact with our commputer
4. User: interact with the computer

## 2.1 the modern computer
## 2.2 components
- CPU: the brain of computer, does all the calculations and data processing
- RAM: short-term memory
- Hard drive: holds all of our data
- Motherboard: the body of the computer that connects all the pieces together
- Trisha：power supply
- MCC: the bridge between CPU and RAM

## 3.1 what's an operating system
***The whole package that manages our computers' resources and let us interact with it***

There are two main parts--the kernel space and the user space.
#### The kernel space
OUr kernel optimizes memory usage and makes sure our applications have enough memory to run.
1. Process Manager--the kernel has to schedule time for the CPU to execute the instructions in the process.It just takes a time slice, the super short interval of time. To human eyes, it looks like it runs simultaneously.

2. Memory Manager--use virtual memory(the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use) to read and load the processes quickly.
3. File Manager--we write data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks. Block storage improves faster handling of data and run the accessed quicker.
4. I/O Manager--devices that perform input and output.

#### The user space
Human interact with our computer through the user space.

## 4.1what is networking
***The Internet***:The physical connection of computers and wires around the world.

***The Web***:The information on the Internet.
- IP Address & MAC Address
- General rules: routed efficiently, aren't corrupted, secure right machine, named appropriately
- IP:deliver packets to right computers
- TCP:deliver information from one network to another
